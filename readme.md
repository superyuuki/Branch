# Branch

An opinionated command framework based around the concept of an argument handling node

Has support for both builder format and annotation format

Built for use with Beetle but can be used independently 

TODO something something Branch Base lets you write subcommands as if they were individual commands, no complex array/iterator or hard thinking required

TODO yada yada Branch Base also lets you write commands the way YOU want to,
with formats for all adherents of 3 popular command styles:

builder with functional interface,
light builder + manually implement any logic-handling node
interface + annotation

yada yada additionally branch is lightweight where you tell it to be. There is no separate executorservice instantiated purely for a command handling framework.
