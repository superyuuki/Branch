/**
 *
 * Fallback and processing strategy that does the following actions:
 *
 * Attempts to get a node via arguments search. It then checks if the user has permission to access the node.
 * If they do not, it falls back a single node and checks again. This repeats until the user has permission or
 * until the search reaches the base node, in which case a response is fired as a failure.
 *
 * In practice:
 *
 * Node tree looks like
 *
 * /kitpvp moderation ban
 * /kitpvp moderation kick
 *
 * User has permissions for kitpvp.moderation but not kitpvp.moderation.ban and tries to execute kitpvp moderation ban
 *
 * Searcher sees no permissions for ban command and so it falls back to the no-args of /kitpvp moderation which is
 * then executed.
